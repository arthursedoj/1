The MAPL system used for music tracks in Canada is similar to the system used in other countries, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. The MAPL system was first introduced in the United States in the 1940s and was later adopted by other countries.

Canada was the first country to adopt the MAPL system for music tracks. In the early 1940s, the Canadian government introduced a law requiring radio broadcasters to play a certain percentage of Canadian music tracks. In response to this law, the Canadian recording industry created the MAPL system as a way to determine the percentage of Canadian content in a music track.

Why are music tracks certified as Canadian Content?
The MAPL system is used to promote Canadian content in the broadcasting industry as required by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). To be eligible for CANCON certification, a music track must meet certain criteria, including the nationality of the recording artist, the lyrics and music composition, and the location of the recording studio. Once a music track meets these criteria, it can be certified as CANCON and given a percentage rating based on the level of Canadian content.

The CRTC requires radio and television broadcasters to play a certain amount of Canadian content each day, which is called the Canadian music quota. The Canadian music quota is set at 35 per cent for radio broadcasters and at 35 per cent for television broadcasters.

What is the Canadian music quota?

The Canadian music quota is the amount of Canadian content that must be played on Canadian radio and television stations. The Canadian music quota is set at 35 per cent for radio broadcasters and at 35 per cent for television broadcasters.

The Canadian music quota was first introduced in the 1940s as a way to promote Canadian culture. At that time, there was a shortage of Canadian music due to the lack of recording studios in Canada. As a result, the Canadian government introduced the Canadian music quota to ensure that a certain percentage of music played on Canadian radio and television stations was Canadian.

The Canadian music quota was later increased to 35 per cent in the 1970s as a result of the 1972 Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Report on the Canadian Music Industry. The report found that Canadian music was not receiving enough exposure on Canadian radio and television stations, and that the Canadian music industry was in need of a boost.

Does the Canadian music quota apply to all music tracks?

The Canadian music quota applies to all music tracks played on Canadian radio and television stations. However, the Canadian music quota does not apply to music tracks that are not played on radio or television, such as music tracks that are played in restaurants or bars.

How does the Canadian music quota work?

The Canadian music quota requires radio and television broadcasters to play a certain percentage of Canadian content each day. The percentage of Canadian content that must be played each day is based on the total amount of time that the station is on the air. For example, if a radio station is on the air for 20 hours a day, it must play at least 20 per cent Canadian content each day.

The Canadian music quota does not apply to music tracks that are not played on radio or television. For example, the Canadian music quota does not apply to music tracks played in restaurants or bars.

How is the Canadian music quota monitored?

The Canadian music quota is monitored by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The CRTC requires radio and television broadcasters to submit monthly reports that include the amount of Canadian content that was played on their stations. The CRTC uses these reports to ensure that broadcasters are meeting the Canadian music quota.

How many music tracks are certified as Canadian Content?

In 2009, the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) reported that more than 100,000 music tracks were certified as Canadian Content.

What is the point system for music tracks?

The point system used for music tracks in Canada is called the MAPL system, which stands for Music, Artist, Performance, and Lyrics. The MAPL system is used to determine the Canadian Content (CANCON) percentage of a music track, which is a requirement for Canadian radio and television broadcasters to play a certain amount of Canadian content.

Under the MAPL system, a music track can earn points in each of the four categories as follows:

Music: The music score, including the melody, harmony, and instrumentation, must be composed by a Canadian to earn one point.

Artist: At least one of the lead vocalists or instrumentalists performing the music must be Canadian to earn one point.

Performance: The music track must be recorded in Canada to earn one point.

Lyrics: The lyrics must be written by a Canadian to earn one point.

To be considered a Canadian song for CANCON purposes, a music track must earn at least two points under the MAPL system. For example, a track with Canadian lyrics and
