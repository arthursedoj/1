what is the name of certification that is used in canada where they are prooving that the music track was created by canadians
The certification that is used in Canada to indicate that a music track was created by Canadians is called the Canadian Content (CANCON) certification. This certification is used by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to promote Canadian content in the broadcasting industry. To be eligible for CANCON certification, a music track must meet certain criteria, including the nationality of the recording artist, the lyrics and music composition, and the location of the recording studio. Once a music track meets these criteria, it can be certified as CANCON and given a percentage rating based on the level of Canadian content.

what is the point system for music track?
The point system used for music tracks in Canada is called the MAPL system, which stands for Music, Artist, Performance, and Lyrics. The MAPL system is used to determine the Canadian Content (CANCON) percentage of a music track, which is a requirement for Canadian radio and television broadcasters to play a certain amount of Canadian content.

Under the MAPL system, a music track can earn points in each of the four categories as follows:

Music: The music score, including the melody, harmony, and instrumentation, must be composed by a Canadian to earn one point.

Artist: At least one of the lead vocalists or instrumentalists performing the music must be Canadian to earn one point.

Performance: The music track must be recorded in Canada to earn one point.

Lyrics: The lyrics must be written by a Canadian to earn one point.

To be considered a Canadian song for CANCON purposes, a music track must earn at least two points under the MAPL system. For example, a track with Canadian lyrics and a Canadian artist would earn two points and meet the minimum requirement for CANCON certification.
