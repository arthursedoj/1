No, Canada was not the first country to introduce a MAPL system for music tracks. The MAPL system was originally developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, and it is now used in many European countries, such as France, Germany, and Spain. In the United States, the MAPL system is used by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to determine the amount of American content in music tracks.

Is the MAPL certification system used for other types of music?
