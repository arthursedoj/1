Canada was the first country to introduce a certification system for music tracks to promote Canadian content in the broadcasting industry. The MAPL system was developed in the 1970s as a response to the broadcasting industry's concerns about the lack of Canadian content. Before the MAPL system was developed, Canadian content was determined by the percentage of Canadian artists on a music track. For example, if a music track contained 60% Canadian artists, it was considered to be 60% Canadian content. The MAPL system was created to provide a more accurate way to determine the amount of Canadian content on a music track.

Why do we need a certification system?
The MAPL system was created to ensure that Canadian music tracks are given airplay on Canadian radio and television stations. Before the MAPL system was developed, Canadian radio and television stations were required by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to play a certain amount of Canadian content. However, the CRTC did not provide any guidelines for how to determine the Canadian content of a music track. The MAPL system was created to provide a more accurate way to measure the Canadian content of a music track.

How do you determine the Canadian content of a music track?
To determine the Canadian content of a music track, you need to consider the nationality of the recording artist, the lyrics and music composition, and the location of the recording studio.

Nationality of the recording artist: At least one of the lead vocalists or instrumentalists must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada.

Lyrics and music composition: The lyrics must be written by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada. The music score, including the melody, harmony, and instrumentation, must be composed by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada.

Location of the recording studio: The music track must be recorded in Canada.

To be considered a Canadian song for CANCON purposes, a music track must earn at least two points under the MAPL system. For example, a track with Canadian lyrics and a Canadian artist would earn two points and meet the minimum requirement for CANCON certification.

What is the minimum requirement for CANCON certification?
To be eligible for CANCON certification, a music track must meet the following criteria:

Nationality of the recording artist: At least one of the lead vocalists or instrumentalists must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada.

Lyrics and music composition: The lyrics must be written by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada. The music score, including the melody, harmony, and instrumentation, must be composed by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada.

Location of the recording studio: The music track must be recorded in Canada.

To be considered a Canadian song for CANCON purposes, a music track must earn at least two points under the MAPL system. For example, a track with Canadian lyrics and a Canadian artist would earn two points and meet the minimum requirement for CANCON certification.

What is the point system used for music tracks?
The point system used for music tracks in Canada is called the MAPL system, which stands for Music, Artist, Performance, and Lyrics. The MAPL system is used to determine the Canadian Content (CANCON) percentage of a music track, which is a requirement for Canadian radio and television broadcasters to play a certain amount of Canadian content.

Under the MAPL system, a music track can earn points in each of the four categories as follows:

Music: The music score, including the melody, harmony, and instrumentation, must be composed by a Canadian to earn one point.

Artist: At least one of the lead vocalists or instrumentalists performing the music must be Canadian to earn one point.

Performance: The music track must be recorded in Canada to earn one point.

Lyrics: The lyrics must be written by a Canadian to earn one point.

To be considered a Canadian song for CANCON purposes, a music track must earn at least two points under the MAPL system. For example, a track with Canadian lyrics and a Canadian artist would earn two points and meet the minimum requirement for CANCON certification.
